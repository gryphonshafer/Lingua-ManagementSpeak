# Lingua::ManagementSpeak - Tool to generate managerial-sounding text and full documents

This module generates grammatically correct, managerial-sounding text and
full-length documents that mean absolutely nothing. It can output sentences,
paragraphs, and whole documents with embedded structure. The goal is to easily
provide filler or lorem ipsen content that has the potential to pass as real.
This module does for geeks what lorem ipsen does for designers.
